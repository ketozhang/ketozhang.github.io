<p>The drag force <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a force of friction that proportional to the velocity of an object and is applied directly opposite to the velocity. We may write such force as a vector simply as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boldsymbol{f} = -f(v) \boldsymbol{\hat v}\]</span></p>
<p>A good approximation for the magnitude is the Taylor series noting that the first term goes to zero.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(v) \approx bv + cv^2 + ... \]</span></p>

<p>If the object traveling is a perfect sphere and traveling much less than the speed of sound then we may approximate using the first two terms of <span class="math inline">\(f(v)\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(\nu) = 2r\beta  + 4r^2\gamma  \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> : radius of the object</p>
