<p>We believe that every fundamental particle in the universe follows the particle-wave duality. This rule does not only apply to quantum mechanics but to all physics which for now we ignore relativity.</p>
<p>When we say particle we often think of the particle independent of outside influence. In otherwords we call this a <strong>free particle</strong>.</p>
