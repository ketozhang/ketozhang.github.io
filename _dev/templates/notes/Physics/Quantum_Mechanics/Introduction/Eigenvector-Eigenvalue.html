<p>The eigenvector-eigenvalue problem is one with the form of,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ A f = \lambda f \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> : matrix or operator applied to the eigenfunction</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> : eigenfunction or eigenvector</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> : the eigenvalue, a constant</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is often to find both the eigenfunction (e.g., wavefunction to the time independent Schrodinger equation) and the eigenvalue (e.g., energy corresponding to the wavefunction)</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics we only deal with <a href="#hermitian-operators">hermitian operators</a> which may be represented as an actual operator or a matrix. With the hermitian operator there are two types of eigenfunctions <strong>discrete</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong> eigenfunctions.</p>
<h2 id="discrete-eigenfunctions">Discrete Eigenfunctions</h2>
<p>The discrete eigenfunctions are physically realizable states.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eigenvalues are real</li>
<li>Eigenfunctions are orthogonal to other eigenfunctions if their eigenvalue are different.</li>
<li>Eigenfunctions with same eigenvalues are considered to be <strong>degenerate states</strong>.</li>
</ul>
