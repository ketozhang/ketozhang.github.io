<p>An operator is a mathematical tool that is in the same category as functions. Like functions, operators can be made up of parameters, constants, and other operators. Operators are difficult to define but you're probably familiar to some like,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \sum \tag{summation operator}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ \frac{d}{dx} \tag{differential operator}\]</span></p>
<p>We wish to use variables (makes our life easier) so by convention operator variables are always written with a hat (i.e., circumflex) like <span class="math inline">\(\hat x\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="hamiltonian-operator">Hamiltonian Operator</h2>
<p>For quantum mechanical purposes, the most important operator is the <strong>hamiltonian operator</strong> which is generally defined as an operator that describes the energy of the system,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat H \equiv  \hat T + \hat V \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat T \equiv  \frac{\hat p^2}{2m} \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> : the kinetic energy</li>
<li><p>The hamiltonian operator describes the system means that its eigenvalue is the energy of the system given by the time independent Schrodinger equation.,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{H}\Psi = E\Psi\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hermitian-operators">Hermitian Operators</h2>
<p>A hermitian operator is defined as an operator with the property,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat Q = \hat Q^* \]</span></p>
<p>In general all observables are hermitian operators (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\hat x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\hat p\)</span>).</p>
