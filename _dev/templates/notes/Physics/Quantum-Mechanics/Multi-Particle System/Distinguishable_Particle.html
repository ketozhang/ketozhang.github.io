<p>A system of distinguishable particles by statistics has a wavefunction equal to the product of each individual particle’s wavefunction,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \psi(x) = \prod_j{\psi_j(r_j)}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>This property comes from the probability of independent systems.</p>
