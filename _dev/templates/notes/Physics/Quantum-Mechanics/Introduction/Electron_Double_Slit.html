<p>Using the famous Young's double slit experiment we can see one of the most interesting properties of quantum particles; for now, let's focus on the electron.</p>
<p>The experiment is set up like any Young's double slit but this time we will use an electron gun (like a cathode ray tube). There's two version of this gun quoted in literature, one that shoots lumps or electron or one that shoots a single electron at a time. I prefer a single electron for simplicity.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-1---unobserved">Experiment 1 - Unobserved</h2>
<p>The first experiment is set up doing 3 tasks with 3 probabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span> for the probability if we only allow the electron to go through slit 1 by closing slit 2.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_2\)</span> for the probability if we only allow the electron to go through slit 2 by closing slit 1.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P_{12}\)</span> for the probability if we allow both slits to be open</li>
</ul>
<p>The result show that the electron follows the property of waves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(P_{12}\)</span> is not particle-like such that it's the sum of <span class="math inline">\(P_1 + P_2\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P_{12} \neq P_1 + P_2\]</span></p>
<p>Instead the electron is actually wave-like such that we define <span class="math inline">\(P_1 = \lvert \phi_1 \rvert^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_2 = \lvert \phi_2 \rvert^2\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    P_{12} =  \lvert \phi_1 + \phi_2 \rvert^2
    %\label{eq:slit probability}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Each electron does not necessrily only have to pass through one slit. It may be pass through multiple or something else. No answer have been agreed upon.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experiment-2---observed">Experiment 2 - Observed</h2>
<p>In this experiment instead of covering the hole, we place a detector at each hole to determine if the electron that landed at the wall comes from slit 1 or slit 2.</p>
<p>The results show that the electron follows the property of particles:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(P_{12}\)</span> is as we expected:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P_{12} = P_1 + P_2 \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It is necessary that the electron either pass on to slit 1 or slit 2.</li>
<li>The difference between this experiement is that the electron interacts with the detector (which emits photons)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have two experiment one shows that the electron is wave-like if we were not to disturb the electron as it travels to the wall and an electron that is particle-like if we do.</p>
<p>One may wonder if we vary the detector's emission so that it distrubs the electrons less we find that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreasing the intensity of the detector only shows the probability that an electron is either wave-like (photon does not hit the electron) or particle-like (photon does hit the electron). This result is trivial to us.</li>
<li>Decreasing the wavelength of the detector is much more interesting. We see that at a certain lower limit wavelength it is <strong>impossible</strong> to tell whether an electron came from slit 1 or slit 2. If the wavelength is much greater than the distance between slit 1 and slit 2 detectors then we will not be able to tell which detector it comes from (Rayleigh criterion). We consider this experiment inconclusive because it's an experimental limit we cannot observe.</li>
</ul>
<p>The experimental limit above is one of the fundamental properties of not only quantum mechanics but of the universe. This limit is most famously called the <strong>Heisenberg uncertainty principle</strong>.</p>
