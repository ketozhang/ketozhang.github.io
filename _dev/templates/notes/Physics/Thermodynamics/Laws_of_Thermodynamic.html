<h1 id="zeroth-law">Zeroth Law</h1>
<p>The zeroth law of thermodynamics comes from the transitive property. It goes:</p>
<p><strong>“If a system is in thermal contact with another system in thermal contact with the third. If any pair is in thermal equilibrium then all system are in thermal equilibrium with eachother”</strong></p>
<p>Even simpler <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1 = \tau_2 = \tau_3\)</span></p>
<h1 id="first-law">First Law</h1>
<p><em>Alias: Thermodynamic Identity</em></p>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics comes from the conservation of internal energy such that the system may gain energy by absorbing heat and may lose energy by using the energy to do work,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \boxed{dU = dQ - dW}\]</span></p>
<p>More useful form of this equation is called the <strong>thermodynamic identity</strong>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{dU = \tau d\sigma - PdV}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="chemical-potential-form">Chemical Potential Form</h2>
<p>The thermodynamic identity may include the chemical potential term in cases where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system may exchange particle with another system</li>
<li>The system may be further divided into subsystem by species where each can chemically react with one another</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \boxed{dU = \tau d\sigma - PdV + \mu dN}\]</span></p>
