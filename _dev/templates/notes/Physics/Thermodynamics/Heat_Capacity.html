<h1 id="heat-capacity">Heat Capacity</h1>
<p>Heat capacity is the amount of <strong>thermal energy</strong> a system can hold per change in temperature.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C \equiv \left(\frac{dU}{d\tau}\right)_\text{const}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Heat capacity is not very useful and cannot be defined for a system that doesn’t keep either pressure (<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>) or volume (<span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>) constant.</li>
<li>Without keeping pressure or volume constant system the energy is often transfered to work (<span class="math inline">\(dW = PdV + VdP\)</span>) # Isovolumetric Heat Capacity # Isobaric Heat Capacity # Chemical Heat Capacity</li>
</ul>
