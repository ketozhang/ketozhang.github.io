<p><strong>Ampere’s Law</strong> is the curl of the magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(\bvec B\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\nabla \times \bvec B = \mu_0 \bvec J
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="integral-form">Integral Form</h2>
<p>More often used is the integral form of Ampere’s law</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\oint \bvec B \cdot \mathcal d \bvec l = \mu_0 I_\mathrm{enc}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this looks very similar to Gauss’ law and it is used within the same geometric symmetry that Gauss’ law is so great at.</p>
