<h2 id="capacitance">Capacitance</h2>
<p>Capacitance is defined as the constant of proportionality between charge and electric potential.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C \equiv \frac{q}{V}
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> : Charge of the positive terminal</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> : The electric potential required to move a charge from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the capacitance is defined with dependence on <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, when describing the capacitance of a specific capacitor this is false as any change in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> also changes <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> stays constant. The capacitance is purely dependent on the geometry of the capacitor.</p>
<h2 id="infinite-sheet">Infinite Sheet</h2>
<p>An infinite plate of an electric field uniformly distributed with electric density <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> produces a electric field of <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{E}\)</span> pointinng normal to the surface on both sides of the slate. Using the Gaussian pill box for area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at a negligible height the enclosed charge is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Q_\mathrm{enc} = \sigma A
\]</span></p>
<p>The surface integral of the electric field is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\oint \boldsymbol{E} \cdot \mathrm d \boldsymbol A = 2\boldsymbol{E}A
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus by Gauss's law,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boxed{E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="infinite-twin-plate-capacitor">Infinite Twin Plate Capacitor</h2>
<p>Consider two plate of metal similar to the <a href="#infinite-sheet">infinite sheet</a> however with a definite area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Fill on plate with purely positive charge <span class="math inline">\(q=Q\)</span> and the other plate purely negative charges <span class="math inline">\(q=-Q\)</span>. We only pay attention to the electric field between the positive plate and the negative plate thus the LHS of Gauss's law is half that of the infinite sheet,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\oint \boldsymbol{E} \cdot \mathrm d \boldsymbol{A} = EA = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}\\
E = \frac{Q}{A}
\]</span></p>
<p>Let the area be much greater than the separation of the two plates <span class="math inline">\(A \gg d\)</span> such that the charge are uniformally distributed along the plate with charge density <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = Q/A\)</span>. Thus the electric field is twice that of the infinite sheet.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}
\]</span></p>
<p>Because the electric field is constant along the uniform sheet, the electric potential is just</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V  = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}d\\
\boxed{C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{A\epsilon_0}{d}}
\]</span></p>
