<h2 id="schmidt-decomposition-by-density-matrix">Schmidt Decomposition by Density Matrix</h2>
<p>The Schmidt decomposition can be seen as a form of the state <span class="math inline">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> such that density operator of that state is a diagonal matrix. Consider the bipartite state,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \ket{\psi}_{AB} = \sum_{i,\mu}a_{i\mu}\ket{i\mu}\]</span></p>
<p>Let's work with the density operator <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A\)</span> such that,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \rho_A \equiv \sum_{i,j,\mu}{a_{i\mu}a_{j\mu}^*\ket{i}\bra{j}}  \]</span></p>
<p>Note that $ _B $ is not necessarily already diagonal but can be diagonalized. Consider the diagonalized matrix of <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\(\rho_A&#39;\)</span> with eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(p_i \in \set{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n}\)</span> corresponding to the eigenvectors <span class="math inline">\(\ket{i&#39;}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{ \ket{\psi}_{AB} = \sum_{i}\sqrt{p_i}\ket{i}\otimes\ket{i&#39;} }\]</span></p>
