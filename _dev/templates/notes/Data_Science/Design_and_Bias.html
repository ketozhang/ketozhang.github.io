<h2 id="types-of-data-sets">Types of Data Sets</h2>
<p>The best data may be an exhaustive data set full of everything you need. This ideal data set is called a <strong>census</strong>.</p>
<p>More commonly one often would uses a <strong>subset</strong> or <strong>sample</strong> of a census. There are many types depending on how they were collection and who participated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chance: </strong> Randomly selected participants of the data</li>
<li><strong>Self-selected: </strong> People are able to participate by choice.</li>
<li><strong>Administrative database: </strong> A conveniently formed data set from initially collected for administration purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="types-of-samples">Types of Samples</h2>
<h3 id="judgmental-sample">Judgmental Sample</h3>
<p>Only certain people are able to become participants determined by the method.</p>
<h3 id="simple-random-sample">Simple Random Sample</h3>
<p>A <strong>simple random sample (SRS)</strong> is a sample where each possible choice gets an equal chance to participate or be chosen.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_1 = P_2 = ...=P_n\]</span></p>
<p>SRS is the most ideal however not always possible.</p>
<h3 id="cluster-sample">Cluster Sample</h3>
<p>A <strong>cluster sample</strong> is one which instead of each individual people are a sample, they are grouped into cluster or groups which are chosen as participants.</p>
<p>For example, if odd numbered participants are in group <strong>O</strong> and even numbered participants are in group <strong>E</strong>. If we chose group <strong>O</strong> to form <span class="math inline">\(\text{Sample A}\)</span>, then we know for sure the probability that odd participants are in the sample and even participants are definitely not in the sample.,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Group O}: \{1, 3, 5, ..., O\}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Group E}: \{2, 4, 6, ..., E\}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_1 = P_3 = ... = P_O = 1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_2 = P_4 = ... = P_E = 0\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> : Number of even participant</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> : Number of odd participant</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example in a Sentence</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grouping everyone by states and randomly choosing a state.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="stratified-sample">Stratified Sample</h3>
<p>Similar to cluster sample, <strong>stratified sample</strong> groups participants however instead we allow all members of a groups to be selected. In a stratified sample one may decide to select only one participant per group.</p>
<p>From here we may decide to choose one from each sample</p>
<p><strong>Example in a Sentence</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grouping everyone by states and randomly choosing a participant from each state.</p>
</blockquote>
