<dd><p>Given the residual between the model and sample, a good metric to measure the distance between the two is the <strong>TVD</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{2}\sum_i|\hat Y_i - y_i|
\]</span></p>
<p>This is often used when the distribution interested <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is multi-dimensional (e.g., ethnicities) where <span class="math inline">\(\sum _i Y_i - y_i = 0\)</span></p>
