<h2 id="choosing-a-statistics">Choosing a Statistics</h2>
<p>Let’s first begin with two categories. In two categories, it is best to look at only one as its proportions must add up to one anyways.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Count</dt>
<dd>Literally count the cases of occurences in the category
</dd>
<dt>Proportion</dt>
<dd>The proportion of the cases of occurences in the category among all occurences.
</dd>
<dt>Discrepency</dt>
<dd><p>The proportion of the category observed that differs from the expected proportion.</p>
<p>Large values of discrepency supports the alternative hypothesis.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="p-value">P-Value</h2>
<p>The <strong>observed significance level</strong> or the more popular synonym the <strong>P-value</strong> is the chance:</p>
<ul>
<li>under the null hypothesis</li>
<li>that the statistic</li>
<li>is equal to the value that was observed in the data</li>
<li>or is even further in the direction that supports the alternative.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="error-probability">Error Probability</h2>
<p>The probability that the P-value agrees with the alternative hypothesis. This is value is equivalent to confidence interval set for the null hypothesis.</p>
