<p>We begin using sampling without replacement by considering a sample size of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> chosen out of a population of also size <span class="math inline">\(n=k\)</span>. Each possible outcome of a sample is unique (we will be dealing with grouping later). Thus the total number of sequences is like shuffling a card of deck with each cards begin unique,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
|\text{sequence of $n$ samples}| = n!
\]</span></p>
<p>The probability of any particular sequence is then,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(\text{sequence of $n$ samples}) = \frac{1}{n!}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="symmetry-between-slots">Symmetry (between slots)</h2>
<p>Notice that the probability of any particular sequence does not depend on the actual elements in a sequence. Another way to state this is that every sequence has equal chances of occuring. Thus if you were to imagine a sequence of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> slots where each slot can be represented as a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(1 \le i \le n\)</span>, then notice that any particular <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> has the probability of being value <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> by,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fixing the value <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> on slot <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span></li>
<li>Permutate the other slots which has <span class="math inline">\((n-1)!\)</span> possibilities</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(X_i = k) = \frac{(n-1)!}{n} = \frac{1}{n}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the probability does not depend on the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> or the position of the slot <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. In addition this implies that given any slot <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, all possible outcomes are equally likely to occur at that slot. This type of relation is called symmetry as any slots are not distinguishable from other (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is distributed the same as <span class="math inline">\(X_{i+1}\)</span>)</p>
<p>You may use this symmetry relation between slots <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The order at which slot occurs does not matter:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  P(X_3, X_{12}) = P(X_1, X_2)
  \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  P(X_1, X_2) = P(X_1 \mid X_2) P(X_2) = \frac{1}{n-1} \frac{1}{n}
  \]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simple-random-sample">Simple Random Sample</h2>
<p>Sampling without replacement for <span class="math inline">\(k \le n\)</span> is called a <strong>simple random sample (SRS)</strong>. Succinctly, an SRS creates a sample that is a subset of a finite population.</p>
<p>Once again consider a deck of size <span class="math inline">\(n=52\)</span> and we like a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(k \le n\)</span>. The total number of possible ordered sequences is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
|\text{ordered sequence of $k$ samples}| = \frac{n!}{k!}
\]</span></p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(k \le n\)</span> it is possible that a sequence is the same as another if we don’t care about the order.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
|\text{unordered sequence of $k$ samples}| = {n \choose k}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the probability depends if you’re counting ordered or unordred sequences.</p>
<h3 id="hypergeometric-probability">Hypergeometric Probability</h3>
<p>Let’s now consider grouping. It only makes sense to group something if the elements in a group are considered indistinguishable for the problem; in other words, we are dealing with unordered sequences. Let the size of such group be <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G \le N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the size of the population. Let the number of samples be is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Let the random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be the number of outcomes that is part of the group of size <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(X=g) = \frac{\binom{G}{g} \binom{N-G}{n-g}}{\binom{N}{n}} \]</span></p>
