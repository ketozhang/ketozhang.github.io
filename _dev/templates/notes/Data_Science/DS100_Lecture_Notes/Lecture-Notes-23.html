<dl>
<dt>Null Model</dt>
<dd>Probability model for explaining the chance process for generating the data
</dd>
<dt>Test Statistic</dt>
<dd>Summary of data, under the null model it has a sampling distribution
</dd>
<dt>Null Hypothesis</dt>
<dd>Any deviation from what is expected is due to chance variability described by the null model.
</dd>
<dt>Alternative Hypothesis</dt>
<dd>An alternative to the null hypothesis. This may be as simple as “the difference is real”.
</dd>
<dt>p-value</dt>
<dd><p>The probability of the observed event or an event rarer than the observed under the assumption of the null model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low p-value does not prove that null model is false</li>
<li>Low p-value signifies that the null hypothesis can be rejected</li>
<li>Typical p-value that is considered low drawn at <span class="math inline">\(p=0.05\)</span> (a rule of thumb but not words to live by)</li>
