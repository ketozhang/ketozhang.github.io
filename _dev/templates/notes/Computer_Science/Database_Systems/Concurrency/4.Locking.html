<p>The locking scheme we will be using is called the <strong>Two Phase Lock (2PL)</strong> to guarantee conflict serializable schedule. The two phases refer to the phases of individual transactions. Those are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Aquisition Phase</strong></p>
<p>Transaction begins by attempting to gather all the locks it can will need. Afterso, we have entered the <strong>lockpoint</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Release Phase</strong></p>
<p>Transaction will begin releasing (all at once if Strict 2PL). Transaction can get no more lock after releasing at least one.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="types-of-locks">Types of Locks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Lock (S or R)</strong>: A lock for reading.
<ul>
<li>More than one transaction can have a shared lock.</li>
<li>Cannot use the shared lock unless the exlusive lock is unlocked</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exclusive Lock (X or W)</strong>: A lock for writing
<ul>
<li>Only one transaction can have a write lock.</li>
<li>Can only get a exclusive lock if both shared and exclusive are unlocked.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stirct-2pl-and-cascade-abort">Stirct 2PL and Cascade Abort</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cascade abort</strong></p>
<p>When transaction abort causes other transaction to abort and undo. This occurs because when a transaction release its lock to another transaction, that transaction will continue its actions regarldess if there’s an abort ahead.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The fix for cascade abort is to make sure all transaction:</p>
<pre><code>1. Release all locks together.
2. Only release during a commit or abort.</code></pre>
<p>This is the the policy <strong>Strict 2PL</strong></p>
<h2 id="lock-manager">Lock Manager</h2>
<p>The lock manager (LM) maintains a table (often hash table) called the that stores the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object name</li>
<li>Set of transactions ids currently with that lock</li>
<li>Lock type</li>
<li>A priority waiting queue of transactions needing the lock.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deadlock">Deadlock</h2>
<p>A deadlock occurs when the wait-for diagram is cyclic. A <strong>waits-for</strong> diagram is the directed graph representing the lock manager. The nodes are transactions and the edges are the relations where a transaction waits for (points to) another transaction to release.</p>
<h3 id="deadline-avoidance">Deadline Avoidance</h3>
<p><strong>Deadlock avoidance</strong> determines the action if some transaction wants a lock that’s taken from another.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wait-Die</strong>
<ul>
<li>Higher priority: wait</li>
<li>Lower priority: die</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Wound-Wait</strong>
<ul>
<li>Higher priority: take over</li>
<li>Lower priroity: wait</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deadlock-detection">Deadlock Detection</h3>
<p>The lock manager can detect deadlocks by creating a waits-for graph. Upon finding a cycle, we can abort one of the transaction.</p>
<h2 id="multi-granularity-locking">Multi-Granularity Locking</h2>
<p>We have the issue on how granular should we be locking (e.g., tables, pages, records). To solve this we introduce new locks called the <strong>intent locks</strong>:</p>
<p>There are 3 intent locks <strong>IS, IX, SIX</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>To get an S or IS lock you need an IS or IX lock on the parent node.</li>
<li>To get an X, IX, or SIX you need a IX or SIX on the parent node.</li>
<li>Any node getting an <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> lock implies that the lower level also has the same lock.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lock-compatibility">Lock Compatibility</h3>
<p>The following tables reperesents combination of locks that do not conflict given two different transactions on the locking the same object.</p>
