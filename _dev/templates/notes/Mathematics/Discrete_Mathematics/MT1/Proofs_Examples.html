<h2 id="stable-marriage">Stable Marriage</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><em><strong>Theorem.</strong> The stable marriage algorithm always halts.</em></p>
<p><em>Proof.</em> First, the SMA halts if no women rejects a man that day. While SMA is running, at least one man gets rejected every day thus crossing a woman off his list. There are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> list with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> woman in each list. At the very least, one man crosses off a woman per day, SMA halts at most <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> days.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Improvement Lemma.</strong> If man <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> propose to woman <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th day, then the following day <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> has a man on hold that she like as much as <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></em></p>
<p><em>Proof.</em></p>
<p>The lemma implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every day, the women either gets the same result or gets a better result</li>
<li>Every day, the men either gets the same result or gets a worse result.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="findtour">FindTour</h3>
<p>For a graph of even degree, FindTour is an algorithm for finding a tour in a graph. The algorithm goes as so,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start from vertex <span class="math inline">\(s \in V\)</span></li>
<li>Walk from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to an untraversed edge incident to the current vertex.</li>
<li>Repeat until there are no more untraversed edge adjuacent to the current.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><em><strong>Theorem</strong></em>: <em>FindTour must get stuck at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span></em></p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Proof</strong></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the current vertex is <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> then the number of untraversed edges are even, else if the current vertex is not <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> then the nubmer of untraversed edges are odd.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because if the current vertex is not <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, then there exist at least one untraverse edge thus FindTour must get stuck at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eulerian-tour-theorem">Eulerian Tour Theorem</h3>
<p><em><strong>Theorem</strong></em>: <em>A graph has an Eulerian tour if and only if all vertices have even degree.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em><strong>Lemma</strong></em>: If a graph has an Eulerian tour then for every vertex, its adjacent edges can be paired up.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Proof (only if)</strong></em>: Assume the graph is an Eulerian tour. By the lemma above, if every edge for every vertex can be paired up then the vertex has an even degree</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Proof (if)</strong></em>: Assume the graph’s vertices all have even degree.</p></li>
