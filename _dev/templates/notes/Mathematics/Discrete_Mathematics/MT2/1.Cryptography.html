<p>The basics of cryptography begins with a story of Alice wanting to send a message <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to Bob. They both know Eve who is an eavesdropper thus they need a why to send their messages securily. Alice encrypts her message with an ecryption <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> such that the message send to Bob is <span class="math inline">\(E(x)\)</span>. Bob on the other hand has a decryption <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(D(E(x)) = x\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="rsa-public-key-schemes">RSA Public Key Schemes</h2>
<p>Public key schemes are methods to allow Bob to recieve encrypted messages without ever meeting Alice. In other words, Bob never had a decryption sent from by Alice. How this work is that Bob creates a digital locker and sends the locker to Alice. Alice can now lock messages in the locker and sends that back to Bob where Bob only has the locker keys. The actual scheme works as so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each person has a <strong>public key</strong> publish to the world and a <strong>private key</strong> secured to themselves.</li>
<li>The public key for say Bob acts as an encoder <span class="math inline">\(E_B\)</span> that allows Alice to send a secure message.</li>
<li>Bob uses his private key to decrypt the message.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="public-key">Public Key</h3>
<p>The public key is generated by a pair of numbers <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. Let's associate two large prime numbers <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> such that,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ N := p \cdot q \]</span></p>
<p>We pick a small value <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> that is a coprime of <span class="math inline">\((p-1)(q-1)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ e : ~~ \gcd\Big(e,(p-1)(q-1)\Big) = 1\]</span></p>
<p>The public key is then <span class="math inline">\((N,e)\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>An encryption of a message <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can be made with a public key by,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ E(x) = x^e \bmod N \]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-key">Private Key</h3>
<p>The private key is the value <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> which is the inverse of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> in the mod space of <span class="math inline">\((p-1)(q-1)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ d: ~~ d\cdot e \equiv 1 \pmod{(p-1)(q-1)} \]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A decryption of an encrypted message <span class="math inline">\(E(x) = x^e\)</span> can be made by,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ D(x^e) = x^{ed} \bmod N \]</span></p>
<p>Along with Fermat's Little Theorem the decryption holds because we can prove that,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x^{ed} \bmod N = x \bmod N \]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fermats-little-theorem">Fermat's Little Theorem</h4>
<p><em><strong>Theorem:</strong> For a prime number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and an integer <span class="math inline">\(a \in \set{1,2,\ldots,p-1}\)</span></em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \]</span></p>
<h3 id="hacking-the-key">Hacking the Key</h3>
<p>The RSA for a large bit value of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is great because there exists no method that can determine the original message <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> given the information <span class="math inline">\((N, e)\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Brute Force Attack</strong></p>
<p>One may try to forcefully try to figure out one of the unknown variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the hacker would attempt to check for every value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ x^e = E(x) \bmod N \]</span></p>
<p>This method requires <span class="math inline">\(O(2^N)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prime Factorization</strong></p>
<p>Another way is to find all the prime factors of <span class="math inline">\(N = pq\)</span> and use <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> to determine the private key <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
