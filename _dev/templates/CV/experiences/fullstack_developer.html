  {% if include_backend %}
  Backend:
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and administered astronomy research MySQL database storing over 4 million calibrated supernovae
      images and metadata to replace the old method of searching for supernovae images using a file server.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designed and developed API web service (Python Flask framework) to interface the mentioned database. This will
      be used in the frontend to access the database.
    </li>
    <li>Developed an XML parser for astronomy's VOEvent convention. This was used in multimessenger astronomy to
      parse NASA's Gamma-ray Coordinates Network alerts (e.g., gravitational wave alerts). This was the first step
      in the process that enrolled our team into an exciting field of multimessenger astronomy.</li>
  </ul>
  {% endif %}
  {% if include_frontend %}
  Frontend:
  <ul>
    <li> Developed an web app to interface the image database replacing the team's tedious and time-consuming
      data-retrieval method from 1-2 days to minutes. The web app uses Python Flask for routing, JQuery (Javascript) for AJAX calls to the backend API server, and HTML5 & CSS3 (Bootstrap) for the web page.
    </li>
    <li> Developed a multimessenger astronomy web app to display gravitational wave alerts from Ligo-Virgo and the images from our telescope that was taken in the region of the gravitational wave candidate.</li>
  </ul>
  {% endif %}
  {% if include_sysadmin %}
  System Administration:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Deployed and administrated research pipelines and softwares in Linux production server using Git for version control, gunicorn + apache + systemd for deploying and monitoring web services.
    </li>
    <!-- <li>
      Maintained python virtual envrionment hierarchy so that users' development, teams' development, and server's production enviornment are not in conflict. and test scripts.
    </li> -->
