      Maintained and extended a <strong>Python</strong>-based <strong>ETL data pipeline</strong> for an ML/AI framework
      that ultimately
      estimates power
      plant
      GHG emissions based on satellite imagery, atmospheric chemistry datasets, and real-time grid operations.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Extract</strong>:
          Built scripts and continuous integration to ingest time series data for power plant
          generations and emission sources and satellite imagery (Google Earth Engine and Planet) at a rate of 100 GB
          per day.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Transform</strong>:
          Developed a data pipeline that transforms data in batch or stream using <strong>Apache Airflow</strong>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Load</strong>:
          Maintained a ML/AI data warehouse composed of various <strong>Google Cloud</strong> technology: Cloud SQL for
          raw data storage, Big Query for storing data transformation from Apache Airflow, and Compute Engine Persistent
          Disk for <strong>instant access to terabytes of training data</strong>.

      Backend:
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and administered astronomy research MySQL database storing over 4 million calibrated supernovae
          images and metadata to replace the old method of searching for supernovae images using a file server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and developed API web service (<strong>Python</strong> Flask framework) to interface the mentioned
          database. This will
          be used in the frontend to access the database.
        </li>
        <li>Developed an XML parser for astronomy's VOEvent convention. This was used in multimessenger astronomy to
          parse NASA's Gamma-ray Coordinates Network alerts (e.g., gravitational wave alerts). This was the first step
          in the process that enrolled our team into an exciting field of multimessenger astronomy.</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Frontend:
      <ul>
        <li> Developed a web app to interface the image database replacing the team's tedious and time-consuming
          data-retrieval method from 1-2 days to minutes. The web app uses Python Flask for routing,
          JQuery (<strong>Javascript</strong>) for AJAX calls to the backend API server, and HTML5 & CSS3 (Bootstrap)
          for the web UI.
        </li>
        <li> Developed a multimessenger astronomy web app to display gravitational wave alerts from Ligo-Virgo and the
          images from our telescope that was taken in the region of the gravitational wave candidate.</li>
      </ul> -->
      System Administration:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Deployed, automated, and administrated research pipelines and softwares in Linux production server using Git
          for version control, <strong>Make + Gunicorn + Apache + systemd for deploying, and automating and monitoring
            web services.</strong>
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
      Maintained <strong>Python</strong> virtual environment hierarchy so that users' development, teams' development, and server's production environment are not in conflict. and test scripts.
