<p>This is a statement of discrepancy with <span class="math inline">\(4.4\sigma\)</span> being the value called the “difference in sigma” (hereon called the discrepancy to prevent confusion). Naturally, the difference between the experiment’s estimates is a good start to get a sense of how to experiment disagree with each other.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta = H_0^R - H_0^P
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(H_0^R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_0^P\)</span> are the Hubble estimate from Reiss et al. (2019) and Planck CMB respectively. The estimates has a distribution where <span class="math inline">\(74.03~\text{km/s/Mpc}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(67.4~\text{km/s/Mpc}\)</span> are their respetive mean and the errors comes from their respective standard deviations (SDs). The difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> being compose of two estimates with distribution also has its own distribution with mean and SD:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Mean}(\Delta) = E\left(H_0^R\right) - E\left(H_0^P\right) = 6.6~\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}\\
\text{SD}(\Delta) = \sqrt{SD\left(H_0^R\right)^2 - SD\left(H_0^P\right)^2} = 1.5~\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}
\]</span></p>
<p>The discrepancy <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> (letter used for reasons explained in the next section), is calculated by dividing the two,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z = \abs{\frac{\text{Mean}(\Delta)}{\text{SD}(\Delta)}} = 4.4 \sigma
\]</span></p>
<p>Though it may be obvious from the equation, to explain why it’s in units of sigma and why we can treat it the same way as <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>-sigma signifance (i.e., with arguments from hypothesis test), you need to look at what discrepancy tells you other than this equation.</p>
<h3 id="diving-into-the-statistics">Diving into the Statistics</h3>
<p>Because we have a confidence interval for an estimate of <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, we are assuming the estimate has a probability distribution. In many cases such as this, the probability distribution comes from posterior distribution or the likelihood distribution.</p>
<p>Consequently, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> being the difference of two estimates means <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> also has its own probability distribution, aptly composed of the joint probability of the two estimates. The distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> represents the chance that the two estimate differ by an amount for all possible amounts.</p>
<p>To make an argument of discrepancy is to argue whether or not two experiments agree with each other; that is, to make a hypothesis that the two experiment agrees (the null hypothesis) or that they disagree (the alternative hypothesis). We cannot reject that two experiment agrees with each other if their discrepancy is small. We quantify this discrepancy setting it to be a statistics of their difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> called the z-score* (hence why it’s called <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z = \abs{\frac{\text{Mean}(\Delta) - 0}{\text{SD}(\Delta)}} = \abs{\frac{\text{Mean}(\Delta)}{\text{SD}(\Delta)}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The z-score or discrepancy is the number of SDs that the difference under the null hypothesis (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\Delta = 0\)</span> the two experiment fully agrees) is away from the observed distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*A little caveat, we only care about the absolute value of the z-score which ignores how we defined <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> (e.g., should it be experiment A minus B or B minu A).</p>

<!-- ### Misconception: Discrepency is Relative
A common misconception that authors contributed to is not directly stating the reference hypothesis.

For the Hubble tension, while Reiss et al. (2019) claims Planck CMB 2018 is $4.4\sigma$ away, Planck CMB 2018 can claim Reiss et al. (2019) to be,

 $$
 \begin{align*}
 \frac{74.03 - 67.4}{1.42} = 4.48 \approx 4.4 \\
 \frac{74.03 - 67.4}{0.5} = 15.1 \approx 15
 \end{align*}
