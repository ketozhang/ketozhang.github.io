title: Variables
---

There are three keywords of variables which are `let`, `const`, and `var`.

## Let

`let` is similar to Python's `with` statements which is a variable that is only valid within a block-level (e.g., loop).

## Constants
`const` is as you expect.

## Variable
`var` keyword is necessary to assign a variable which differs from many languages:

```js
var name = 'My Name'
```

Like Java, it is not necessary to instantiate a variable. By default declared variable that are not instantiated are `undefined` type,

```js
var a; // undefined type
var a = undefined // equivalent to above
```
