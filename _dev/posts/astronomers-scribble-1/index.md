description: "The $N$-sigma significance has always been notoriously confusing for students."

astronomy programs not emphasiszing probability theory and/or measurement logistics in their courses. Additionally, the confusion is add on by authors unable to correctly form statistically valid statements when claiming "$N$-sigma" significance level of their results. Take for example,

**The underlying nature of measurements are random and probalistically distributed.**

## Motivating Example - Calculating Significance

1. Significance of Signals

	The simplest to understand is how significant a signal is.

	> **Note:** How significant to is the signal to what?
	It's how significant the signal is to the error. This has strong implications of null hypothesis and proposed hypothesis that will be described later.

	In the real world, attempting to measure some signal always comes with error or noise. To keep the example simple let's assume the only error comes from the measuring instrument.

2. Significance of Estimation

## Errors are Random (i.e., Random Variables)

## Estimates are Random
