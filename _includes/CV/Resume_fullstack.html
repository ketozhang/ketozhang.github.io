      Backend:
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and administered astronomy research MySQL database storing over 4 million calibrated supernovae
          images and metadata to replace the old method of searching for supernovae images using a file server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and developed API web service (Python Flask framework) to interface the mentioned database. This will
          be used in the frontend to access the database.
        </li>
        <li>Developed an XML parser for astronomy's VOEvent convention. This was used in multimessenger astronomy to
          parse NASA's Gamma-ray Coordinates Network alerts (e.g., gravitational wave alerts). This was the first step
          in the process that enrolled our team into an exciting field of multimessenger astronomy.</li>
      </ul>
      Frontend:
      <ul>
        <li> Developed a web app to interface the image database replacing the team's tedious and time-consuming
          data-retrieval method from 1-2 days to minutes. The web app uses Python Flask for routing, JQuery (Javascript) for AJAX calls to the backend API server, and HTML5 & CSS3 (Bootstrap) for the web UI.
        </li>
        <li> Developed a multimessenger astronomy web app to display gravitational wave alerts from Ligo-Virgo and the images from our telescope that was taken in the region of the gravitational wave candidate.</li>
      </ul>
      System Administration:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Deployed, automated, and administrated research pipelines and softwares in Linux production server using Git for version control, Make + Gunicorn + Apache + systemd for deploying, and automating and monitoring web services.
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
      Maintained <strong>Python</strong> virtual environment hierarchy so that users' development, teams' development, and server's production environment are not in conflict. and test scripts.
    </li> -->
