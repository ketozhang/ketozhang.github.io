title: Introduction to Microlensing
---

Here we introduce discovering exoplanet with microlensing.

## Pros and Cons

* Does not depend on the flux of the host star and planet therefore we can detect faint ones
* However, distant and faint host star and planet makes it harder to characterize its properties
* Does not need accurate position (astrometry) or trajectory (radial velocity) to detect microlensing events.
* Since microlensing is short lasting, we barely see the planet orbits the host star thus there is little information about its orbit.
* The planet must lie within the eintsein radius. For typical microlensing setup, this places the planet at about $2$ to $4$ $\text{AU} (M/M_\odot)^{1/2}$
* Microlensing events are rare and unpredictable. Events where the planet and background star aligns are even more rare therefore we need high density regions like galactic bulges
* High density regions are susceptible to photometric noise and require high angular resolution to distinguish light signals.
