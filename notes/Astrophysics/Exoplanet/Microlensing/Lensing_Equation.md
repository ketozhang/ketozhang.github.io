## Point Mass Lens

In the setup where the lens is a point mass, we have the observer (O), lens (L), background source (S), and the observed image (I). The lensing equation relates the angular of separations

\[
  \theta_{IS} = \theta_{IL} - \theta_{LS}
\]

All angles above is relative to the observer.

In terms of the actual deflection angle $\hat \theta_{IS}$ (i.e., relative to the lens and not the observer), we use the small angle approximation

\[
  \hat\theta_{IS} (D_S - D_L) = \theta_{IS} D_S
\]
