title: Period-Luminosity Relation
---

The **period-luminosity relation** (**P-L relation** or **Leavitt's law**) is a relation between the pulsation period of the variable star to its luminsoity.

The strongest relation is the P-L relation for classical cephieds which is a linear relation between the period and luminosity. This relation is commonly written in log-scale:

\[
  M = \alpha (\log_{10} P - 1) - \beta
\]

* $M$ : Mean absolute magnitude
* $P$ : Period (days)
* $\alpha$, $\beta$ : Scale and location free parameters. These are determined with a large enough sample of cepheids

## Distance Estimate

If we have at the apparent and absolute magnitude of the variable star then we can determine its distance modulus. For the classical cepheids, we can use the P-L relation to estimate distance to any given cepheid only if we have a set of cepheids with known distances. We first obtain a sample of observed periods and mean absolute magnitudes (i.e., by using the known distances) and then fit the free parameters in the P-L relation. From then we assume this relation to be universal and apply it to cepheids estimating its absolute magnitude and comparing it with the observed apparent magnitude.

\[
\mu = M(\hat\alpha, \hat\beta) - m_\text{obs}
\]
