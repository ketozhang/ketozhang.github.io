<p>Replacing earnings with sales, the P/S ratio is the dollar amount an investor is willing to pay per dollar amount the company sells</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[\text{P/E}] = \frac{[\text{Stock Price}]}{[\text{SPS}]}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where SPS is the annual sale per share,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
[\text{SPS}] = \frac{[\text{Annual Sale}]}{[\text{# of Shares}]}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="relation-to-pe-ratio">Relation to P/E Ratio</h2>
<p>The P/S ratio is used to compare with the P/E ratio as an efficiency measurement. A good company should have high earnings compared to their sales thus high P/E compared to P/S ratio.</p>
