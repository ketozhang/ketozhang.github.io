<p>The coriolis force is defined as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 2m\dot {\mathbf r} \times \boldsymbol \Omega\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\dot{\mathbf r}\)</span> : velocity vector of the object <strong>relative to the rotating frame</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is very similar to the force induced by a magnetic field ($F_B = q $) that causes charged particles to spiral around a direction of the <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>-field. The exact same spiral occurs with the coriolis force but at a much weaker extent.</p>
