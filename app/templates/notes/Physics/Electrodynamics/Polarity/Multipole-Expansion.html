<p>At a large distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> from a charge source, we can approximate the charge to be a point source. However, we wish to generalize for any distance away from a source. Consider a charge source well-structured in an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-pole configuration. The potential located at <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol r\)</span> from the origin and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> distance away from the a geometric slice of the source <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm d \mathcal V\)</span> located at <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol r&#39;\)</span> is given by,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(\boldsymbol{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\int{\frac{\rho(\boldsymbol{r&#39;})}{d} \mathrm d \mathcal V}
\]</span></p>
<p>The distance here however changes as the geometric slice <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm d \mathcal V\)</span> changes. It turns out that the inverse distance <span class="math inline">\(1/d\)</span> are the Legendre polynomials.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{d} = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{r&#39;}{r}\right)^n P_n (\cos \alpha)
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the angle between <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{r&#39;}\)</span>. Thus the exact potential is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(\boldsymbol{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{r^{n+1}}\int{(r&#39;)^n}P_n(\cos\alpha)\rho(\boldsymbol r&#39;) \mathrm d \mathcal V
\]</span></p>
