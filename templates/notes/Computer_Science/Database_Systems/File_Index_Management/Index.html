<p><strong>Index</strong> is a data structure that enables fast lookup
and modification of data entries by search keys. Often times the index
is stored with the data pages which the whole file is called an
<strong>indexed file</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>Lookup</dt>
<dd>
A function that may include equality, 1-d range, 2-d region, etc.
</dd>
<dt>Search Key</dt>
<dd>
Any subset of columns in the relation. Search key does not need to be
unique.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Modification</strong></dt>
<dd>
Support for fast insert and delete
</dd>

<ul>
<li>We consider index as a tuple of search key and record ID serving as
a pointer to the reference heap file.</li>

<h2 id="indexed-sequential-access-method">Indexed Sequential Access
Method</h2>
<p>The <strong>index sequential access method (ISAM)</strong> is a high
fan out tree.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Key Invariant</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>For node <span class="math inline">\([...,(K_L, P_L), (K_R,

nodes on the children to the right and less than the children to the

<li><strong>Search</strong>

<li>Time complexity of <span class="math inline">\(O(\log_F(P))\)</span>

number of pointers pointed to a single data page)</li>

<li><strong>Insert</strong>
<ul>
<li>Append to free space and resort</li>
<li>If there are no free space then a linked list is appended to the

<h2 id="b-tree">B+ Tree</h2>
<p>A similar tree to ISAM and improves some flaws of ISAM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Same interior node structure with key invariant</li>
<li>Same search routine</li>
<li>Dynamic tree index:
<ul>
<li>Always balanced</li>
<li>Support efficient insertion &amp; deletion</li>
<li>Grows at root not leaves</li>

was named for this variant)</li>

<dd>
<p>Each interior node (excluding the root) is at least partly full:</p>
<ul>

entries on a node.</p></li>
<li><p>The maximum fanout is <span class="math display">\[ F_\text{max}

<li>Scan all and range are slower since the data linked list can be
partially full.</li>
<li><strong>Insertion</strong>
<ul>
<li>If data/leaf node is full, split the node in half placing the middle
number at the right half. Then, copy that middle number to the parent
node. Sorting must be done at both instructions</li>
<li>If index node is full, split in half placing the middle number to
the parent node.</li>
<li>If root is full, increase the height and follow the index node
instructions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Deletion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Occupancy invariants don’t need to be followed for deletion so there
is no need for deletion unless a page becomes full.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bulk Loading</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple insertion is quite slow.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sort the input records by key</li>
<li>Once page is filled with <span class="math inline">\(d + 1\)</span>
(or occupancy of a node is equal to the fill factor), create the parent
node.</li>
<li>Continue until parent node is full where you need to split.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Bulk loading is faster, have leaves be stored sequentially, and you
can control the fill factor (default <span class="math inline">\(d +
1\)</span>) of the pages.</li>

<li><p><strong>Scan</strong></p>
<p>During scanning, we ignore traversing the tree and go straight to the
leaf nodes. The number of elements in all leaf nodes depends on the fill
factor <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. For <span
