<p><strong>Index</strong> is a data structure that enables fast lookup and modification of data entries by search keys. Often times the index is stored with the data pages which the whole file is called an <strong>indexed file</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>Lookup</dt>
<dd>A function that may include equality, 1-d range, 2-d region, etc.
</dd>
<dt>Search Key</dt>
<dd>Any subset of columns in the relation. Search key does not need to be unique.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Modification</strong></dt>
<dd>Support for fast insert and delete
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>We consider index as a tuple of search key and record ID serving as a pointer to the reference heap file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indexed-sequential-access-method">Indexed Sequential Access Method</h2>
<p>The <strong>index sequential access method (ISAM)</strong> is a high fan out tree.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Key Invariant</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For node <span class="math inline">\([...,(K_L, P_L), (K_R, P_R),...]\)</span>, the parent node must be greater than or equal to nodes on the children to the right and less than the children to the left.</p>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search</strong>
<ul>
<li>Time complexity of <span class="math inline">\(O(\log_F(P))\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is the fanout (the maximum number of pointers pointed to a single data page)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Insert</strong>
<ul>
<li>Append to free space and resort</li>
<li>If there are no free space then a linked list is appended to the leaf page and becomes overflow (<strong>major flaw</strong>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="b-tree">B+ Tree</h2>
<p>A similar tree to ISAM and improves some flaws of ISAM.</p>
<ul>
<li>Same interior node structure with key invariant</li>
<li>Same search routine</li>
<li>Dynamic tree index:
<ul>
<li>Always balanced</li>
<li>Support efficient insertion &amp; deletion</li>
<li>Grows at root not leaves</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All data stored at the leaves (the B tree store at the nodes so B+ was named for this variant)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Occupancy Invariant</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Each interior node (excluding the root) is at least partly full:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(d \le |\text{node}| \le 2d\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the order of the tree and <span class="math inline">\(|\text{node}|\)</span> is the number of entries on a node.</li>
<li>The maximum fanout is <span class="math display">\[ F_\text{max} = 2d+1 \]</span></li>
<li>The maximum number of entries in a single node is <span class="math inline">\(2d\)</span></li>
<li><p>The maximum number of records is given by its height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\texttt{depth}-1\)</span>) and maximum number of entires <span class="math inline">\(2d\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ |B|_\text{max} =  (2d+1)^{h-1} \cdot 2d\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Scan all and range are slower since the data linked list can be partially full.</li>
<li><strong>Insertion</strong>
<ul>
<li>If data/leaf node is full, split the node in half placing the middle number at the right half. Then, copy that middle number to the parent node. Sorting must be done at both instructions</li>
<li>If index node is full, split in half placing the middle number to the parent node.</li>
<li>If root is full, increase the height and follow the index node instructions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Deletion</strong>
<ul>
<li>Occupancy invariants don't need to be followed for deletion so there is no need for deletion unless a page becomes full.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bulk Loading</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple insertion is quite slow.</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sort the input records by key</li>
<li>Once page is filled with <span class="math inline">\(d + 1\)</span> (or occupancy of a node is equal to the fill factor), create the parent node.</li>
<li>Continue until parent node is full where you need to split.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Bulk loading is faster, have leaves be stored sequentially, and you can control the fill factor (default <span class="math inline">\(d + 1\)</span>) of the pages.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Scan</strong></p>
<p>During scanning, we ignore traversing the tree and go straight to the leaf nodes. The number of elements in all leaf nodes depends on the fill factor <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> data pages in the leaf node there are a total of <span class="math inline">\(B/f\)</span> pages,</p>
