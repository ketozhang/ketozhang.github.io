<h3 id="concurency-problems">Concurency Problems</h3>
<p>We will need to tackle the following problems when allowing concurrency.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Inconsistent Read</strong> User reads in the middle of a transaction</p></li>
<li><strong>Lost Update</strong>
<ul>
<li>A conflict with update where multiple users update the record. Any update may have been rejected.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dirty Read</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reading transactions to be rejected</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Confusion: Even with concurrency control, in using SQL interactively what happens when User A reads before and after User B changes the database</em></p>
