<p>The solution to concurrency control is to treat the user's queries as a single transaction. A <strong>transaction</strong> (or Xact) is a batch of queries that are extracted to line by line instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>A sequence of read and writes to the DBMS</li>
<li>Transactions are applied to the database once commited and ended or else they are aborted.</li>
<li>Any logic (e.g., arithmetic) are computed within the transaction and not known to the DBMS.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>The basic properties of a transaction are acronymed to be ACID:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Atomicity</strong></p>
<p>All actions in the transaction happen or none of it happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solved by requiring every transaction to have a <code>COMMIT</code> action at the end of their transaction. This line must be ran otherwise the transaction aborted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
<p>If the DB starts out consistent, it ends up consistent at the end of the transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can intepret consistency using the schema.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolation</strong></p>
<p>Execution of each transaction is isolated from that of the others</p>
<ul>
<li>Solved with a transaction manager/scheduler</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Durability</strong></p>
<p>If a transaction commits, then its effects persist.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions are logged, if the transaction is not commited then use the log to undo. If the transaction is commited then use the log to redo.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
