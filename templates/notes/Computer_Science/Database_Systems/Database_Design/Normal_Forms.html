<p>For at table with functional dependencies is in BCNF if for all <span class="math inline">\(X \rightarrow A\)</span>,</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq X\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a superkey for <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, a table is in BCNF if there exist no attribute that is a functional dependency of another except for the trivial functional dependency of the key constraint.</p>
