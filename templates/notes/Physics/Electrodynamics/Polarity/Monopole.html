<p>The monopole is the first term (<span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span>) of the multipole expansion. For a charge source of total charge <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(\boldsymbol r) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r}
\]</span></p>
<p>This equation mirrors the exact potential for a point charge at distance <span class="math inline">\(d=r\)</span> where we center the origin at the point charge.</p>
