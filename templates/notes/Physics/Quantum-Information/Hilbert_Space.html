<dt>Axiom 1</dt>
<dd>A state is a ray in the Hilbert space. A ray is a general case of a vector that need not to have an origin and need not to be represented by basis vectors.
</dd>
<dt>Axiom 2</dt>
<dd><p>An observable is a self-adjoint Hermitian operator on the Hilbert space.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recall that an operator is defined as a thing that linearly transforming some state <span class="math inline">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> where linear here means:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ A(a\ket{\psi} + b\ket{\varphi}) = aA\ket{\psi} + bA\ket{\varphi}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Self-adjoint means that the operator acted upon a braket can be either done by first acting on the bra or firt acting on the ket,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \bra{\varphi}A\ket{\psi} = A\bra{\varphi}\ket{\psi}\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Property: Real Eigenvalues</dt>
<dd><p>Recall that if,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ A\ket{\psi} = a\ket{\psi} \]</span></p>
<p>then we are sure that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is real and <span class="math inline">\(\ket{\psi}\)</span> is a vector that can from the complete basis of the Hilbert space.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Property: Spectral Representatoin</dt>
<dd><p>Given <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> eigenstates denoted by the ket vector <span class="math inline">\(\ket{n}\)</span>, we may write the operator as a linear combination of each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th eigenstate's projection vector. This is called the <strong>spectral representation</strong> of the operator.</p>
<p>The projection vector is defined as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P_n \equiv \ket{n}\bra{n} \]</span></p>
<p>We form the spectral representation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ A = \sum_{n}^N{a_nP_n} \]</span></p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Axiom 3: Unitarity (Dynamics)</dt>
<dd><p>A unitary operator is where its hermitian conjugate equals its inverse,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{align}
    U^\dagger \equiv (U^*)^T \\
    \boxed{U^{\dagger} = U^{-1}} \tag{Unitary}
\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The time evolution is unitary and described by a self adjoin operator called the Hamiltonian. Recall the Schrodinger Equation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{\d}{\d t}\ket{\Psi} = -iH\ket{\Psi} \tag{$\hbar = 1$}\]</span></p>
<p>For instance we can represent an infinitesimal time step as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \ket{\Psi(t + \d t)} = \ket{\Psi(t)} - iH\ket{\Psi(t)} \d t = (1 - iH\d t)\ket{\Psi(t)}\]</span></p>
<p>In general this is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ket{\psi(t)} = U(t-t_0)\ket{\Psi(t_0)} \\
U(t-t_0) = \exp\left[-i\int{H\d t}\right]
\]</span></p>
<p>The unitary operator preserve orthonomality <span class="math inline">\(\bra{\varphi}\ket{\psi}\)</span> given that the same unitary operator applies to both states (interpret as if the Hamiltonian and time elapsed is the same for the two states),</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \bra{u\varphi}\ket{u\psi} = \bra{\varphi}\ket{\psi} \]</span></p>
</dd>
