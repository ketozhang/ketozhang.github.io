<h1 id="coexistence-of-phases">Coexistence of Phases</h1>
<p>Consider a substance in isothermal such that we are able to vary its volume and pressure. We may graph this in a curve called the <strong>isotherm</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on liquid and gas phase (all of this applies between solid-gas and solid-liquid as well). At a certain isotherm the two liquid and gas phase may coexist if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the isotherm lies below a <strong>critical temperature</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\tau_c\)</span> such that</li>
<li><p>the two phases are in thermal, diffusive, and pressure equilibrium</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_l=\tau_g, \quad \mu_l=\mu_g, \quad P_l = P_g\]</span></p></li>
<li>note that the the substance will in a certain phase if that phase’s chemical potential is the lowest:
<ul>
<li>Gas: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_g &lt; \mu_l\)</span></li>
<li>Liquid: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_l &lt; \mu_g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_l &lt; \mu_s\)</span></li>
<li>Solid: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_s &lt; \mu_l\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="coexistence-curve-and-clausius-claperyon-relation">Coexistence Curve and Clausius-Claperyon Relation</h1>
<p><em>Alias: Vapor Pressure Curve, Vapor Pressure Equation</em></p>
<p>The coexistence curve is a pressure-temperature curve along which two phases may exist (coexist). For the case of liquid and gas, the coexistence curve has the slope given by the Clausius-Claperyon Relation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\boxed{\frac{dP}{d\tau} = \frac{L}{\tau \Delta \nu}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> : Latent heat of vaporization</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta \nu\)</span> : The change in volume if a single particle would change from liquid to gas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="derivation">Derivation</h2>
<p>The coexistence curve follows the following differential equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{dP}{d\tau} = \frac{\frac{\partial \mu_l}{\partial \tau} - \frac{\partial \mu_g}{\partial \tau}}{\frac{\partial \mu_g}{\partial P} - \frac{\partial \mu_l}{\partial P}} \]</span></p>
<p>We can represent this better using the definition of the differentials of the Gibbs free energy</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{gathered}
    \frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{dG}{dP}\right)_{N,\tau} = \left(\frac{d\mu}{dP}\right)_{\tau} = \frac{V}{N} \equiv \nu\\
    \frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{dG}{d\tau}\right)_{N,P} = \left(\frac{d\mu}{d\tau}\right)_{P} = \frac{\sigma}{N} \equiv s\\
    \boxed{\frac{dP}{d\tau} = \frac{s_g-s_l}{\nu_g-\nu_l} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta\nu}}
\end{gathered}
\]</span></p>
<p>While confusing we’ll use:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> which relates to the volume per particle. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\nu\)</span> is the change in volume if we were to transfer one particle from one phase to another</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> the entropy per particle. This changes the differential equation to a state equation. <span class="math inline">\(\Delta s\)</span> is the change in entropy if we were to transfer one particle from one phase to another</li>
</ul>
<p>We may use the <strong><a href="#latent-heat-of-vaporization">latent heat of vaporization</a></strong> to simplify the vapor pressure equation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ L \equiv \frac{dQ_{l\rightarrow g}}{N} = \frac{\tau(\sigma_g - \sigma_l)}{N}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[L \equiv \tau(s_g - s_l)\]</span></p>
<p>Replacing this definition to <span class="math inline">\(dP/d\tau\)</span> above gives the <strong>Clausius-Claperyon equation</strong>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \boxed{\frac{dP}{d\tau} = \frac{L}{\tau \Delta \nu}} \]</span></p>
<h2 id="clausius-claperyon-of-the-ideal-gas">Clausius-Claperyon of the Ideal Gas</h2>
<p>The Clausius-Claperyon relation has a useful form in the ideal gas such that</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Delta \nu \approx v_g = V_g/N_g\)</span> since gas takes up more volume by many orders <span class="math inline">\(v_g / v_l \approx 10^3\)</span></li>
<li>Ideal gas law is followed so that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta v \approx V_g/N_g = \tau/P\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The vapor pressure equation them becomes,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{gathered}
    \frac{dP}{d\tau} = \frac{L}{\tau^2}P \\
    \boxed{\frac{d}{d\tau}\log{P} = \frac{L}{\tau^2}}
\end{gathered} 
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="coexistence-curve-of-the-ideal-gas">Coexistence Curve of the Ideal Gas</h3>
<p>If we assume that <span class="math inline">\(L=L_0\)</span> does not depend on temperature then we can easily integrate the Clausius-Claperyon equation to the coexistence curve.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\begin{gathered}
    \int{\frac{dP}{P}} = L_0 \int{\frac{1}{\tau^2} d\tau} \\
    \boxed{P(\tau) = P_0e^{-L_0/\tau}}
\end{gathered}

<h1 id="latent-heat-of-vaporization">Latent Heat of Vaporization</h1>
<p>The amount of heat transfered a single particle of liquid to gas is called the <strong>latnet heat of vaporization</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L \equiv \frac{dQ}{N}\]</span></p>
