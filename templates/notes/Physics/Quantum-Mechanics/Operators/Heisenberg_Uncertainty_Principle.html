<p>The <strong>Heisenberg uncertainty principle</strong> is a fundamental property of nature which limits how accurate any experiment can be made. Most famously we use the following statement and equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One may never measure exactly both the position and the momentum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accuracy to which both the uncertainty of position <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and momentum <span class="math inline">\(\Delta p\)</span> must satisfy this equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2} \]</span></p>
<p>Why only position and momentum? Actually, it applies to a lot more than just position and momentum. It is better to ask why position and momentum has this limit and in general what other combination of observables has this limit. The general Heisenber uncertainty principle is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One may never measure two observables exactly if the two observables do not commute.</p>
