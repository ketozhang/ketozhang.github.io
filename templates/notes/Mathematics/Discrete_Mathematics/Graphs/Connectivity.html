<dt>Theorem: Minimum Edges</dt>
<dd>A connected graph with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> vertices must have at least <span class="math inline">\(E-1\)</span> edges,,
</dd>
</dl>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  E \ge V + 1

<p>Do note that a disconnected graph can also have <span class="math inline">\(E \ge V + 1\)</span>.</p>

<dt>Theorem: Maximum Edges</dt>
<dd>A connected graph with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> vertices has at maximum edges of a complete graph.
</dd>

<p><span class="math display">\[
  E \le {V \choose 2} = \frac{V!}{2!(V-2)!}

<h2 id="cut-edge-and-vertex">Cut Edge and Vertex</h2>
<p>A cut edge is an edge that will increase the number of connected graphs when removed. The same goes for cut vertex.</p>
<h3 id="bridge-algorithm">Bridge Algorithm</h3>
<p>The bridge algorithm finds cut bridges by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start at any vertex, label it 0</p></li>
<li><p>We begin DFS. One each visit</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mark it with increasing index.</li>
<li>Store the path taken</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For each vertex, determine it’s low-link value. A low-link value is the vertex, along it’s directed path that was previous stored, with the lowest index.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From here, all edges <code>(a,b)</code> where <code>id(a) &lt; lowlink(b)</code></p>
<h3 id="articulation-algorithm">Articulation Algorithm</h3>
<p>The articulation algorithm finds cut vertices by first running the bridge algorithm and noticing:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(V&gt;=2\)</span>, <code>(u, v)</code> is a cut edge then either <code>u</code> or <code>v</code> are articulation points.</li>
<li>If there is no bridge, check for cycles by checking any vertex has its own index as it’s low-link value.
<ul>
<li>Except for the case where the starting node <code>id(v) == 0</code>, only has one outgoing edge. A cut vertex needs more than one outgoing edge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
