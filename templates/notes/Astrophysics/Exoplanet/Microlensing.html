<p>Here we introduce discovering exoplanet with microlensing.</p>
<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Does not depend on the flux of the host star and planet therefore we can detect faint ones</li>
<li>However, distant and faint host star and planet makes it harder to characterize its properties</li>
<li>Does not need accurate position (astrometry) or trajectory (radial velocity) to detect microlensing events.</li>
<li>Since microlensing is short lasting, we barely see the planet orbits the host star thus there is little information about its orbit.</li>
<li>The planet must lie within the eintsein radius. For typical microlensing setup, this places the planet at about <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\text{AU} (M/M_\odot)^{1/2}\)</span></li>
<li>Microlensing events are rare and unpredictable. Events where the planet and background star aligns are even more rare therefore we need high density regions like galactic bulges</li>
<li>High density regions are susceptible to photometric noise and require high angular resolution to distinguish light signals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lens-equation-for-point-mass">Lens Equation for Point Mass</h2>
<p>In the setup where the lens is a point mass, we have the observer (O), lens (L), background source (S), and the observed image (I). The lensing equation relates the angular of separations</p>
<p>[ = _{IL} -  ]</p>
<p>All angles above is relative to the observer.</p>
<p>In terms of the actual deflection angle <span class="math inline">\(\hat \alpha\)</span> (i.e., relative to the lens and not the observer), we use the small angle approximation</p>
<p>[ (D_S - D_L) = D_S\ =   ]</p>
<p>With these observed properties, we can determine the gravitational properties from solving how much light bends at a distance <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> away from the point mass lens. Now treating <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\boldsymbol\theta}_{IS}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol b\)</span> as positonal vectors with the lens as the origin.</p>
<p>[  =   ]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although not stated, this equation seems to assume the source light ray comes in parallel to the line of sight between the observer and lens. This is true if the <span class="math inline">\(D_L\)</span> is sufficiently large.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="len-equation-for-multiple-point-masses">Len Equation for Multiple Point Masses</h2>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> lens of mass <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> and angular position <span class="math inline">\(\theta_{m,i}\)</span> all located on a plane (i.e., face-on the observer) at distance <span class="math inline">\(D_L\)</span>, the effective deflection angle is additive</p>
<p>[ (_{IL}) =  <em>i^N{m_i }\ D</em>^{-1} D_L^{-1} - D_S^{-1} ]</p>

<p>[ = +  ]</p>
<p>If the lens and source are exactly aligned (<span class="math inline">\(\beta = 0\)</span>) then the image is a ring of the given angular radius known as the Einstein ring radius,</p>
<p>[ _E  ]</p>
<p>The Einstein ring radius is a useful quantity to normalize all angles. In this scale, we define <span class="math inline">\(u \equiv \beta/\theta_E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \equiv \theta/\theta_E\)</span>. Then the lens equation becomes,</p>
<p>[ u = y - y^{-1} ]</p>
<p>The solution to this is similar to the quadratic equation,</p>
<p>[  ]</p>
<p>Therefore if the source and lens are misaligned (<span class="math inline">\(\mu \neq 0\)</span>) then there exist two images: the positive solution (major image) is on the same side as the lens and source; the negative solution (minor image) is on the opposite side.</p>
<p>The magnification is the determinant of the Jacobian of <span class="math inline">\(u, y\)</span>. For small sources, the image elongates the source tangentially by the amount <span class="math inline">\(y_\pm/u\)</span> but compressed radially by the amount <span class="math inline">\(dy_\pm/du\)</span>. Therefore the magnitifcation equation is,</p>
<p>[  ]</p>
<p>and total magnification,</p>
<p>[ A(u) =  ]</p>
<p>A few edge cases for magnitification,</p>
<ul>
<li>If the source-lens separation is much smaller than the Einstein radius [u  A /u]</li>
<li>If the source-lens separation is much larger than the Einstien radius [u  A  + 2u^{-4}]</li>
<li>If the source-lens separation approaches infinity, the major image is the unlensed source and the minor image vanishes behind the lens. [ u (y_+ u,, A_+ ); (y_-  ,, A_- ) ]</li>
</ul>

<p>The observer, source, and lens are all in relative motion. Regardless, of the actual motion in the perspective of the source and lens, what makes affects the image is the angular separation as seen by the observer. In other words we can only have to focus on the proper motion <span class="math inline">\(\mu_\text{rel}\)</span> which can be approximated as a constant.</p>
<p>[ \ ]</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(t_E\)</span> is the Einstein ring crossing time at a constant proper motion,</p>
