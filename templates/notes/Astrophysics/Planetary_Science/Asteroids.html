<h1 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h1>
<p>Let's do some fast definitions:</p>
<p><strong>Asteroids</strong><br />
A general term for rocky minor planets</p>
<p><strong>Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNO)</strong><br />
The most small bodies in our Solar System lies beyond Neptune's orbit thus called TNOs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Kuiper Belt Objects (KBO)</strong><br />
Icy bodies living in the Kuiper belt (low inclination and eccentricity orbits) that are also TNOs.</p>
<p>The most famous KBO is <strong>Pluto</strong> (first discovered) and <strong>Ceres</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Near Earth Objects (NEO)</strong><br />
Objects that come near Earth with perihelia of less than ~1.3 AU.</p>
<p>The dynamical lifetime of NEOs is at max ~<span class="math inline">\(10^7\)</span> yrs</p>
<p><strong>Trojan Asteroids</strong><br />
Asteroids that orbit the Lagrangian points of Jupiter.</p>

<h2 id="sedna">Sedna</h2>
<p>90377 Sedna is a KBO and was discovered at a perihelion of 76 AU and aphelion of 900AU which is phenomenal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sedna is considered to live in the inner Oort cloud.</li>
<li>It is unknown why Sedna orbits so much further than the rest. Most theorize a perturbation of some sort either by stars, a far planet, or came from somewhere else.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="asteroid-statistics">Asteroid Statistics</h1>
<h2 id="size-distribution">Size Distribution</h2>
<p>Due to numerous collisions in the early history of the Solar System it,the size distribution of the asteroid follows a power law:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
    N(R) &amp;= \int_{R_0}^{R_1}{\frac{N_0}{R_0}\left(\frac{R}{R_0}\right)^{-\zeta} dR}\\
    N(R) &amp;= \int_{R}^{R_\text{max}}{\frac{N_0}{\zeta - 1}\left(\frac{R}{R_0}\right)^{-\zeta} dR}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where the second line is the cumulative equation,</p>
