<h2 id="flux">Flux</h2>
<p>The power of the emitting source on a unit surface area. Also known as <strong>bolometric flux</strong> or <strong>radiant flux</strong> in astronomy and <strong>irradiance</strong> in other fields. The SI units are watt per square meter.</p>
<p>[ F =  ]</p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is flux, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is luminosity or power, and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the area.</p>
<h2 id="spectral-flux">Spectral Flux</h2>
<p>The power of the emitting source on a unit surface area for a unit wavelength. Also known as <strong>spectral irradiance</strong> in other fields. The SI units are watt per square meter per meter.</p>
<p>[ F_=  ]</p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(F_\lambda\)</span> is the spectral flux and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the wavelength</p>
<p>You may also define the spectral flux in frequency instead of wavelength.</p>
