<p>Type Ia supernovae (Ia) are most famously known for their standardizable property of their luminosity. With large numbers of Ia scattered across various distances, one can build a distance ruler to better make or calibrate distance measurements to other objects.</p>

<p>The de-facto standard method used for standardization is the two-parameter luminosity correction (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1998A&amp;A...331..815T/abstract">Tripp 1998</a>).</p>
