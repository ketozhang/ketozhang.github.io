<h2 id="scale-factor-and-comoving-distance">Scale Factor and Comoving Distance</h2>
<p>To begin talking about the expanding universe, one must have the notion of the scale factor and comoving distance. Imagine a cartesian grid drawn on the universe. Each tick mark in the grid corresponds to the <strong>comoving distance</strong> and the distance of each tick marks corresponds to the <strong>scale factor</strong>.</p>
<!-- TODO: Diagram of cartesian grid  -->
<p>We may interpret this with defining distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> in terms of the the scale factor <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and co-moving distance <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>. A stationary object <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> co-moving distance away is actually <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> away where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ r(t) = a(t) \cdot \chi \]</span></p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\(a(t)\)</span> is a function of time but not <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>. If the object is not moving relative to the co-moving space <span class="math inline">\(\dot\chi = 0\)</span> then the exansion of the universe keeps <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> constant.</p>
<h2 id="hubbles-law">Hubble’s Law</h2>
<p>Hubble’s law came from an empirical observation of the universe (like most cosmology), at which Hubble is credited with noticing (although poorly) the receding velocity (velocity going away from observer) of an object in space seems to be correlated with the distance away from the observer (in general, Earth; we will correct this misconception later). This relationship is written as the <strong>Hubble’s law</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{v_r(t) = H(t) \cdot r}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v_r\)</span> : Receding velocity</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> : Distance of the object</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(H(t)\)</span> : Hubble’s constant, dependent on time</li>
</ul>
<p>If time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is today then the Hubble constant becomes,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ H_0 = \frac{v_r(t_0)}{r} = 100 \frac{\text{km/s}}{\text{Mpc }\mathrm{h^{-1}}} \approx 72 \; \frac{\text{km/s}}{\text{Mpc}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> : a empirical constant absorbed into the units, not to be confused with Planck’s constant. One may often use <span class="math inline">\(h = 0.72\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This literally means “for every megaparsec, the object recedes away from the observer with a velocity of <span class="math inline">\(70\; \text{m/s}\)</span> purely due to the expansion of space.”</p>
<p>A general intuition of the <strong>Hubble’s constant</strong> is the percentage of change in the universe’s space. We characterize the universe’s space or “length-like” by the <a href="#scale-factor">scale factor</a> such that,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{H(t) \equiv \frac{a&#39;(t)}{a(t)}}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
