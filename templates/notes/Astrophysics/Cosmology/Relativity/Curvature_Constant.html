<p>The curvature constant comes from the concept credited to Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevski who came up with the experiment that one can tell the curvature of the universe by drawing a large enough triangle.</p>
<p>Consider the three angle of the triangle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha,\; \beta,\; \gamma\)</span>. Recall that in Euclidean space (or common sense) that the three angle of the triangle should add up to <span class="math inline">\(180^\circ = \pi\)</span>. In an non-Euclidean space there exist a generalized equation for the sum of these angles for an isosceles triangle is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\begin{equation}
    \alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi + \frac{\kappa A}{R_0^2}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> : Area of the triangle</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> : Radius of curvature of any side (notice the radius of curvature for a straight line is <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> : The curvature constant which is either <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or $ $</li>
</ul>
<p>Often times, we do not need to deal with this number much doing cosmology so we assign a different form of the <strong>curvature constant</strong>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\begin{equation}
    k \equiv \frac{\kappa}{R_0^2}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
