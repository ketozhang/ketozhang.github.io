<h3 id="non-negative-probability">1. Non-negative Probability</h3>
<p>The probability of any event must be non-negative:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    P(x) \ge 0
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="outcome-space-is-unitary">2. Outcome Space is Unitary</h3>
<p>The length of the outcome space must be 1,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(\Omega) = 1\\
\text{or}\\
\sum_{x \in X}p(x) = 1
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="mutually-exclusive---addition-rule">3. Mutually Exclusive - Addition Rule</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Two events are mutually exclusive if the intersection is the empty set</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A \cap B = \emptyset\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>If two events are mutually exclusive then the probability is additive:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\]</span></p>
<p>In general, one may see the notation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P\left(\bigcup_i^n A_i\right) = \sum_{i}^n P(A_i) \]</span></p>
<p>This is called the <strong>addition rule</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Corollary - Subtractive Rule</dt>
<dd>From the additive rule we can derive the difference rule. The difference rule is if we have two events of relations <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq A\)</span> then we can find the probability of events in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> but not in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> denoted as <span class="math inline">\(A \backslash B\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(A - B\)</span>,
</dd>
</dl>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{gather*}
P(A) = P(B) + P(A\backslash B)\\
\big\Downarrow\\
P(A \backslash B) = P(A) - P(B)
\end{gather*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Additionally another result of the difference rule is the <strong>complement set</strong> <span class="math inline">\(B^C\)</span> which means the event that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> doesn’t happen,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
B^C = \Omega - B\\
P(B^C) = 1-P(B)
\]</span></p>
