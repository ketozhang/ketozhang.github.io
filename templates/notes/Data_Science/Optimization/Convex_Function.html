<p>A convex function is a satisfied if for every pair of points <span class="math inline">\(x_1 &lt; x_2\)</span>, if you were to draw a line through the two points then there exists no value <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(x_1 \le x \le x_2\)</span>) such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is above the line. This condition implies two important properties of either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The convex function has no extrema</li>
<li>The convex fucntion has a single extrema</li>
<li>All extremum are global extrema.</li>
</ul>
