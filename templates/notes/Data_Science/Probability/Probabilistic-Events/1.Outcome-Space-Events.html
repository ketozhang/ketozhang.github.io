<h2 id="outcome-space">Outcome Space</h2>
<p>For a probabilistic system, there exist all possible outcomes denoted as a set <span class="math inline">\(\Omega = \set{\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_n}\)</span> known as the <strong>set of outcomes</strong>, <strong>sampling space</strong>, <strong>outcome space</strong>.</p>
<p>The probability of an outcome in the outcome space is denoted simply as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\omega) \]</span></p>
<h2 id="event">Event</h2>
<p>An event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is formally a subset of the outcome space.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A \subseteq \Omega \]</span></p>
<p>The probability of event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the sum of each outcome probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(A) = \sum_{\omega \in A} P(\omega)\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uniform Distribution:</strong> If it so happens that the probability of <span class="math inline">\(P(\omega)\)</span> is equal for all <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> then the outcome space is said to have a uniform distribution. This simplifies the probability of an event which is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(A) = \frac{\abs{A}}{\abs{\Omega}} \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Some motivation on why an event is a subset and not simply an outcome <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>:</p>
<p>For a dice, the outcome space is <span class="math inline">\(\set{1,2,3,4,5,6}\)</span>. An event could be if we roll a <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>. An event can also be if we roll an even number. These events are denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\set{6}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\set{2,4,6}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus the purpose of seeing events that are sets is the logic that some events are consist of multiple outcomes.</p></li>
</ul>
