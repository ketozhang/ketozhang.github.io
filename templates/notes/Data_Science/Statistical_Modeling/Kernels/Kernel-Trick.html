<p>To explain the kernel trick we will look at the example of the polynomial design function <span class="math inline">\(\Phi(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let's define the polynomial kernel function as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
k(x, z) = (x^\top z + 1)^p
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the kernel function is also the dot product of the design function,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
k(x, z) = \Phi(x)^\top  \Phi(z)
\]</span></p>
<p>The computation for the first kernel function is much faster than the dot product at the second. This is the key to the performance boost in the kernel trick.</p>
