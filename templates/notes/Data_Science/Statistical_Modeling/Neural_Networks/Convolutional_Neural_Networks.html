<p><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> are used for amount of features that implements same transformation to different subsets of the features. CNNs are often used for images hence features are pixel values and a single convolution is a single subset of the image being transformed.</p>
<p>CNN implements the ideas of,</p>
<ul>
<li>Local connectivity: A hidden unit connecting to small patch of units in the previous layer</li>
<li>Shared weights: Groups of hidden units share same set of input weights called mask, filters, or kernels.</li>
</ul>
